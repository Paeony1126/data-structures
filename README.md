# data-structures
coding practice during winter
Tentative schedule includes:
  AVL, RB-Tree, & a lazy-balancing RB-Tree
  Hashing & collision resolution: chaining, probing, cuckoo hash
  Binary heap, binomial heap, fibonacci heap, key decreasing for binomial and fibonacci
  disjoint set forest & path compression
  Predecessor DS: x-fast trie & y-fast trie
  B-Tree, constant-time ranking-dictionary, predecessor DS from B-Tree
  Exponential search tree
  van emde boas tree
  order maintenance DS
  Priority Q with O(f(n)) insert/delete & constant find-min from any O(nf(n)) sorting algo.
